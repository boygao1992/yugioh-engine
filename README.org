* Goal
** self-replicate
*generalized* genetic algorithm
*** no fixed mutation rate and survival rate
mutation or non-perfect reproduction should be economically beneficial
*** no fixed selection criteria
the notion of survival needs to be as general as possible
** composition 
*** patterns of boundaries of common objects are learned through direct interaction 
"grab on" to form a coherent body is the initial way to sense boundary and produce perceptual variance
, which is fundamental to semiotic system and intelligence
** generalization
*** self-adaptive representation for the universe
